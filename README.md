# vkgl-consensus
This script generates the consensus table for the VKGL project
To run: incude a config.txt in the directory of this project. The file should look like: config_example.txt.
Also add a OMIM_to_HGNC.txt, a tab separated file with in the first column the omim number and in the second the related gene
Make sure you have loaded tables with the metadata of the VKGL project on your molgenis server.
Now run VKGL_consensus_table_generator.py
